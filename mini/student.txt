In the student account when he opens his account a menu bar will be shown to the left in that menu bar there will be some sections such as
1) Dash board
2) Active Works
3) Completed Works(Suggest better name)
4) All campus projects(Suggest better name)

What I want from you is from the above sections I want detailed components what I can display for each section and other thing which I want is when I select active works it need to show list of items with naming as that particular subject if it is CBP for other types it need to show fieldProject/ miniProject/ majorProject

Now when a student clicks on particular item it need to display detailed description of their project and also the team members and below that a review table where each row of the table displays basic information of that particular review and once student clicks on view more it again need to display a separate page with more details of that review 

Understand this prompt and format it perfectly so that I can make some ideas out of it and give everything what I want take as much time you want and give me every detail and complete response












Here’s a detailed, structured response based on your requirements, broken down into components and functionality for each section in the Student Account. I've included ideas for what you can display, as well as detailed workflows for navigating through projects and reviews.

Menu Bar Structure and Section Details
1. Dashboard
Purpose: A quick overview of the student’s account and project-related information.

What to Display:
Welcome Message: Greet the student with their name.
Summary Cards/Stats:
Number of Active Works (e.g., 2 projects ongoing).
Number of Completed Works (e.g., 3 projects completed).
Notifications count (e.g., "3 new updates from your guide").
Upcoming Reviews (e.g., "Next review: 25th Jan 2025").
Quick Access Section: Links to key actions like:
“View Active Projects”
“Check Notifications”
“Review Progress Timeline”
Enhancements:
Interactive Progress Chart: A small donut or bar chart showing the percentage of progress across active projects.
Notifications Section: Display a scrolling list of recent notifications.
2. Active Works
Purpose: A list of all ongoing projects, categorized by type (CBP, Field Project, Mini Project, Major Project).

What to Display:
A list of projects, with each project represented as a tab or card.
Each tab/card should include:

Clicking on View More opens a new Detailed Review Page.
3. Completed Works (Suggested Name: Past Projects or Archived Projects)
Purpose: A list of all projects that have been completed and finalized.

What to Display:
A list of completed projects, with the same card layout as Active Works, but including additional details:
Submission Date
Final Grade/Approval Status (if applicable, e.g., "Approved with A+").
Guide’s Final Feedback Summary (e.g., "Great work on the final implementation").

Downloadable content (e.g., PDFs, final presentations).
Review history table for archival purposes.
4. All Campus Projects (Suggested Name: Explore Campus Projects or Global Projects)

Filter by Project Type (CBP, Mini Project, etc.).
Filter by Tags (e.g., AI, Web Development, Healthcare).
List of Projects:
Display each project as a card with:

Guide Name
Team Members (count only)
Summary/Abstract
Tags/Domain
Submission Date
Action Buttons:
"View Details" (leads to detailed project description).
"Request Access" (if access is restricted).
Workflow (When Clicking on a Card):

Enhancements for Usability
Search Functionality:
Allow searching for specific projects, reviews, or notifications.

Responsive Layout:
Ensure all pages (menu bar, cards, tables) work seamlessly on mobile and desktop.
Conclusion
This structure provides a comprehensive workflow and display plan for the student account, including clear navigation, detailed project views, and intuitive review tracking. Let me know if you’d like further refinements or additional components!
